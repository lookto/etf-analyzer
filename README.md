# etf-analyzer
=================


ETF-Analyzer is a small project for, like the name suggests, analyzing your (future) ETF portfolio.
It was created after i wanted to visualize my ETF portfolio regarding diversification across countries, markets and industries
and found no good free tool. I first did it in a spreadsheet, manualy importing every single ETF datapoint by hand.
Thats when the idea was created make this my first opensource project. 


## Disclaimer



This is my first fullstack project and also my first project in js. Please keep that in mind.
